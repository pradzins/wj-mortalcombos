Mortal Combos or refactorings in Eclipse - Warsjawa 2014 edition
===============

To make things as smooth as possible, please make sure you'll have:
- your own computer (well, basically a laptop, you Android/iOS/Windows Phone device will be probably insufficient, at least not this year);
- Eclipse 4.3 (the 'for Java developers' version will be OK);
- JDK 7;
- Git client installed in the OS (EGit itself will not be enough). 

Clone this repo and check if at least one test passes. 

Yes, the repo is almost empty at the moment. It contains an initial state of the sophisticated legacy code we will work on.
